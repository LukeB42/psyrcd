### The Psybernetics IRC Server.

Psyrcd is a pure-python IRCD that supports scriptable commands, user modes and
channel modes, the behavior of which can be redefined while in use.

A NickServ and ChanServ are included as scripts.

**Note:** Psyrcd is noticably faster with [uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop) installed.
